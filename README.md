Jodd
====

Jodd is set of open-source Java tools and frameworks; compact, but powerful.


## Building Jodd

Jodd is built with Maven 3 on JDK6. After cloning Jodd git repo,
you can build the full release with:

    mvn -P release

If you need to generate various reports after the successful build:

    mvn -P post-release

To quickly build just bundle distribution jar (no tests are invoked):

    mvn -P dist

That's all what you need to know;) - todo BUILD ALL JARS!
