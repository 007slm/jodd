Follow these steps:\r\n\r\nFirst time only:\r\n+ fork the **Jodd** repo (`upstream`) to your GitHub account (`origin`).\r\n+ clone `origin` as your `local` repo\r\n\r\nEvery other time:\r\n+ update both `origin` and `local` repos from `upstream`\r\n+ create new branch for a feature or bug fix\r\n+ commit often :)\r\n+ once when work is done, push local changes to your `origin`\r\n+ send us a pull request (PR)\r\n\r\nWe will pickup up from here:)\r\n","google":"UA-153514-4","note":"Don't delete this file!
